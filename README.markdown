This repository is a prototype of a DI Framework for PHP based upon the prototype of a [DI container](https://github.com/weierophinney/zf-examples) for PHP built by Matthew Weier O'Phinney.  This is an idea for a component that could possibly be a foundational component within the Zend Framework, hence, the Zend namepsace.

There are 3 main forms of dependency injection: constructor injection, setter injection and interface injection.  Currently, there is only an example of *constructor injection*, but there will be more to follow.

To test what is currently available, clone this repository and check out the README inside the examples `examples/constructor-injection` directory.
